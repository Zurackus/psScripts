#First I pulled all of the people who had a number assigned to them

<#
Pull all users assigned Teams Phone numbers
Get-CsOnlineUser | Where-Object  { $_.LineURI -notlike $null } | select UserPrincipalName, LineURI
#>

#Then I pulled all of AD enabled users with the below command

<#
Pulll all AD users that are currently active from AD
get-aduser -filter "(enabled -eq 'true')" -properties title, company, department, officephone, canonicalname, whencreated, officephone, office, mail, lastlogontimestamp, employeeID | export-csv ADenabled.csv
#>

#Than I merged the two, filtering down to just the users I needed. Collecting the existing phone number in AD and their SamAccountName

<#
# ---csv---
#SamAccountName OfficePhone
#user1          Phone1
#user2          Phone2
#user3          Phone3
import-csv "C:\Users\tkonsonlas\psScripts\PhoneNumberImport.csv" | ForEach-Object {Set-ADUser -Identity $_.SamAccountName -OfficePhone $_.OfficePhone}
